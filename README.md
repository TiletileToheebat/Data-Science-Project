# Predictive Modeling for COVID-19 in Public Health

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building predictive models to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases using publicly available datasets. The goal is to analyze patterns and trends in COVID-19 data to help inform public health policies. The primary dataset used for this project is the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), supplemented by several other data sources for analysis.

### Key Objectives:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about COVID-19 spread and patterns.
- Build predictive models for forecasting confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- Generate actionable insights to inform public health decisions.

## Data Sources
The following datasets are used for this project:

1. **covid_19_clean_complete.csv** – A dataset containing complete COVID-19 case information.
2. **country_wise_latest.csv** – A country-level dataset with the most recent COVID-19 data.
3. **worldometer_data.csv** – Another source of country-level COVID-19 data.

These datasets were chosen for their comprehensiveness and to capture various factors related to COVID-19. Only a subset of these datasets were used for modeling, with the focus primarily on confirmed cases.
